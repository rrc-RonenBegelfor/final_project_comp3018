# New Component Plan

## IP Geolocation

- ipstack

  - A real-time IP Geolocation API service.

### Implementation Plans

I plan to implement ipstack so then I could fetch which city an individual is from.

### Integration Plans

By using the city I fetched from the individual's location, they can then match with a GET method which will return their city with the worst disaster (chosen based on statistics, which would be damage).
